# Steam-project-2 / Tilemania

This is me experimenting with the Unity engine. Feel free to take peaces of the code for your projects if you need to. 
TileMania is a 2D game like the old classic Super Mario in the core gameplay and game mechanics. 
There is no story because, as I said before, this was just a random project so I was focused on mechanics and the "make it work" philosophy.
